Setting up the project
======================

-  This project relies on several `python
   dependencies <#python-dependencies>`__.
-  A `discord bot application and channels <#discord-bot-component>`__
   have to be created.
-  A `MongoDB database <#preparing-mongodb-component>`__ is used for
   persistent data storage.
-  Jaeger accounts are pulled from a `Google
   Sheet <#preparing-google-component>`__.
-  To retrieve Planetside2 information a `Daybreak Census
   ID <#assigning-census-id>`__ has to be provided.
-  To use the TeamSpeak 3 Integration, set up an instance of
   `TS3AudioBot <#teamspeak-integration>`__.
-  Finally, to initialize the application, `scripts
   functions <#populating-the-collections>`__ are provided.

Python dependencies
-------------------

-  Python 3.6 or above is required to run the project.
-  We recommend using `pipenv <https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/>`__ to
   set up the project environment. Pipenv will install automatically
   install the required dependencies from the ``Pipfile`` provided with
   the project.
-  Alternatively, the dependencies are also listed in the
   ``requirements.txt`` file (compatible with
   `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__)

Notes for the developer
-----------------------

-  Master branch is a release branch, it will stay clean and is synced
   with the official POG hosting server.
-  So developments should be done on feature or development branches and
   will be then merged in.
-  Keep fork repos up to date from upstream as much as possible.
-  ``google_api_secret.json`` and ``config.cfg`` are not available for
   confidentiality reasons, templates are given instead.
-  The code of the application itself can be found in the ``bot``
   folder. It contains:
-  The ``cogs`` folder: it holds cogs modules as described in
   discord.py. Each of them regroups a set of commands and their
   associated checks. These modules are not to be imported in any way
   (they are only launched through the discord.py client)
-  The ``display`` folder: it is a python package handling all the
   display from the application to discord. All discords embed and
   strings used are stored there.
-  The ``modules`` folder: it is a python package containing general
   interfaces and tools that can be used in the rest of the application.
-  The ``classes`` folder: it contains the main classes of the
   application: ``Player``, ``Team``, ``Weapon``, ``Base``, ``Account``,
   etc...
-  The ``lib`` folder: it contains third-party modules that were
   modified for the purpose of the application.
-  The ``match`` folder: it contains all the code handling the match
   processes and commands.

Discord Bot Component
---------------------

Create a bot application following the `discord.py
documentation <https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html>`__.
The client-secret retrieved at this manual has to put into the
configuration file:

.. code:: cfg

    [General]
    token = RetrievedDiscordApiBotToken

Create channels and roles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To retrieve discord channel, message and role-ids you have to enable
Discord Developer Mode which can be toggled at appearance. ``Copy ID``
will then appear at the right click menu for channels, messages and
roles. At that point you can populate the ``[channels]`` and
``[roles]``\ sections of the configuration file.

Preparing MongoDB Component
---------------------------

Pymongo is used for interaction with the mongodb. The database should
contain several collections: - One for the user data. - One for the
bases. - One for the weapons. - One for the matches. - One for the
player stats - One for persistent restart data - One for jaeger account
usage Check ``script.py`` to populate the databases. The naming of these
collections can be configured at the ``[Collections]`` part of the
configuration file.

There are two common ways to get MongoDB running: `Atlas <#Atlas>`__ and
`Manual Deployment <#manual-deployment>`__.

Atlas
^^^^^

Atlas can be run using a free instance at `MongoDB Cloud
Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ When using MongoDB Atlas
the following URI format is expected:

.. code:: cfg

    [Database]
    url = mongodb+srv://username:password@clusteruri/databasename
    cluster = ClusterName

Manual Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using a single manually deployed MongoDB instance, omit ``+srv``
and remove the database name from the ``url`` and put it at ``cluster``
instead:

.. code:: cfg

    [Database]
    url = mongodb://username:password@host:port/
    cluster = DatabaseName

Preparing Google Component
--------------------------

The Gspread module is used for interaction with google API. `Follow
these steps to create your
google\_api\_secret.json <https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html#for-bots-using-service-account>`__

Prepare Google Sheet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example sheet has been provided called
``accounts_sheet_template.xlsx``. By creating a new Google Sheet in your
Drive and importing the excel file through the menu you can avoid format
and naming convention errors.

The ``accounts`` field from the ``[Database]`` section of the
configuration file has to contain the ID of the Google Sheet. This ID
can be easily retrieved from the URI of the document:
``https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/GOOGLE_SHEET_ID/edit#gid=0``.

Finally, add the service account email to the shared users with editor
permissions to the google sheet. This email is also listed as
``client_email`` in the ``google_api_secret.json`` file.

Assigning Census ID
-------------------

Communication with the Daybreak Census API is required to retrieve game
information, therefore you have to supply a Service ID. You can apply
for one at the `Daybreak
Census <http://census.daybreakgames.com/#service-id>`__ website. Once
you obtained an ID, add it the configuration as ``api_key``:

.. code:: cfg

    [General]
    api_key = Daybreak_Registered_Service_ID

Teamspeak integration
---------------------

The bot used for Teamspeak audio integration is Splamy's
`TS3AudioBot <https://github.com/Splamy/TS3AudioBot>`__. This bot works
on the dotnet runtime and can be built and installed following the
readme available in TS3AudioBot github's repo.

TS3-bot folder structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The structure of the TS3AudioBot folder is the following:

::

    TS3-bot
    +-- TS3AudioBot.dll
    +-- rights.toml
    +-- ts3audiobot.toml
    +-- ...
    +-- audio
    |   +-- audio_file_1.mp3
    |   +-- audio_file_1.mp3
    |   +-- ...
    +-- bots
    |   +-- 1
    |   | +-- bot.toml
    |   +-- 2
    |   | +-- bot.toml
    |   +-- 3
    |   | +-- bot.toml
    |   +-- ...

The audio files should be put in the ``audio`` repository. Each
sub-repository of ``bots`` represent TS3 bot (one bot per match channel
is needed).

Main configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first file to modify is ``ts3audiobot.toml``. The relevant
parameters for are listed below. You may want to change the parameters
depending on your project file structure.

.. code:: cfg

    [configs]
    # Path for the bots
    bots_path = "bots"

    [factories]
    # Path for audio files
    media = { path = "audio" }

    [bot.audio]
    # Activate subscription-based whispers
    send_mode = "!whisper subscription"


    [bot.connect]
    # TS3 default connect information
    address = Your_TS3_Url
    channel = Your_TS3_Bot_Channel_Id (example: /10)

Additionally, add access to all commands for localhost in the
``rights.toml`` file:

.. code:: cfg

    # Admin rule
    [[rule]]
            # Treat requests from localhost as admin
            ip = [ "::ffff:127.0.0.1" ]
            "+" = "*"

Configuring individual bots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each individual bot can also be configured, in each ``bot.toml`` files.
This allows for example to change the name of each individual bot.

.. code:: cfg

    [connect]
    # Client nickname when connecting.
    name = "POG_3"

Setting up TS3 channels IDs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Teamspeak`` section of the configuration file can now be completed

.. code:: cfg

    [Teamspeak]
    url = # Teamspeak bot webapi url
    lobby_id = # Lobby channel id
    matches = # Matches channel ids (example: 1/2/3,4/5/6) (matches separated by commas, channels by slashes, no spaces)

Populating the collections
--------------------------

The file ``scripts.py`` contains two functions called
``push_accounts()`` and ``get_all_maps_from_api()``. The file
``weapons_script.py`` contains the function ``push_all_weapons()``.
Running all of these functions will populate the MongoDB users, bases
and weapons collections, allowing you to run ``main.py``.
